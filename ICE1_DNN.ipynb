    "\n",
    "### Set up the layers\n",
    "The basic building block of a neural network is the [layer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers). Layers extract representations from the data fed into them. Hopefully, these representations are meaningful for the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers. Most layers have parameters (such as weights and biases) that are learned during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this network, we will build a [sequential model](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model) with the following layers (in order):\n",
    "1. Flatten\n",
    "2. Dense\n",
    "3. Dropout\n",
    "4. Dense\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential models are useful for stacking layers where each layer has one input [tensor](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor) and one output tensor (tensors are kind of like arrays). This is exactly how our layers will work: we will have input arrays and output arrays for each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first layer in this network, we want to use a flatten layer transform the format of the images from a two-dimensional array (of 28 by 28 pixels) to a one-dimensional array (of 28 * 28 = 784 pixels). Think of this layer as unstacking rows of pixels in the image and lining them up. This layer has no parameters to learn; it only reformats the data. The input shape will be the only required argument for the first layer of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the pixels are flattened, the next layer of the network is a dense layer. This is a densely connected, or fully connected, neural layer. The first Dense layer will need to have 128 nodes (or neurons) with a \"reLu\" activation. The number of nodes and type of activation will be the two arguments required for the second layer of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dense layer is followed by a dropout layer. Dropout layers randomly set input units to 0 with a particular frequency of `rate` at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1/(1 - `rate`) such that the sum over all inputs is unchanged.  Overfitting happens when a machine learning model performs worse on new, previously unseen inputs than it does on the training data. An overfitted model \"memorizes\" the noise and details in the training dataset to a point where it negatively impacts the performance of the model on the new data. Adding a dropout layer can prevent overfitting. The layer command does the math for you, but the rate we will set is 0.2. The rate will be the only required argument for the third layer of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dropout layer is followed by another dense layer (also the last layer of the network). This layer returns a logits array (unnormalized log probabilities) with a length equivalent to the number of classes in your dataset. Each node contains a score that indicates the current image belongs to one of the classes. The number of nodes will be the only argument required for the final layer of your model."
