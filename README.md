# Taylor's Lab 1 Repo - Relu funtions and stuff
**(Workday 1/30, Due 2/1 2359)**

(1) This is a repository I made for lab 1, I don't know how to delete the ICE files from it.


(5) Run Black to check your code for minor errors and improper formatting using the following command (I did this in the terminal within VS code): `black --check .`   

If the output does not say "All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú® 1 file would be left unchanged.", you'll need to edit the code to resolve the issue. You can take a look at how Black would reformat your code using `black --diff .` Edit the code accordingly to resolve the issue and run again. Repeat until the output is "All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú® 1 file would be left unchanged.". You could also simply run `black .` to automatically make the changes, but I strongly recommend you understand what changes are made prior to submitting your file.
