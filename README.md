# In Class Exercise 1 - Deep Neural Networks  
**(Workday 1/30, Due 2/1 2359)**

(1) Fork this repository.

(2) Ensure you are using your 495 Virtual Environment created via instructions [here](https://github.com/kaitlin-fair/495venv_setup). 

(3) Open ICE1_DNN.ipynb. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the code. 

(5) Run Black to check your code for minor errors and improper formatting using the following command (I did this in the terminal within VS code): `black --check .`   

If the output does not say "All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú® 1 file would be left unchanged.", you'll need to edit the code to resolve the issue. You can take a look at how Black would reformat your code using `black --diff .` Edit the code accordingly to resolve the issue and run again. Repeat until the output is "All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú® 1 file would be left unchanged.". You could also simply run `black .` to automatically make the changes, but I strongly recommend you understand what changes are made prior to submitting your file. For troubleshooting and more ways to use Black, click [here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html)

(6) Upload your GitHub repository into Gradescope under "ICE1 - Deep Neural Nets" assignment by T9 (Thurs, Feb 1), 1159. If the autograder fails, you did not successfully run Black. You can resubmit as many times as needed prior to the due date. You are also encouraged to schedule time for EI to debug as needed: [Book here](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/94f514961fa3476ab9598d4a2173d076@afacademy.af.edu?anonymous&ep=plink)

## A few notes for both ICE1 and ICE2
The second half of the course will require a lot of self-study. In preparation for what that will entail, you will be required to look through support documentation as you work through this ICE (and future ICEs and Labs). For this ICE, I'll point you toward useful resources. As we go through more ICEs and Labs, you will see there is less guidance on finding support documentation. The hope is to gradually grow your independent research skills and ensure you truly understand what you are programming and why you're programming it.  

Please utilize the support documentation provided _prior_ to asking ChatGPT anything. ChatGPT should be a supplementary resource, not the only resource.  

ChatGPT _should not_ be utilized to blindly write code or complete any of the assignments for this class. Remember that you will have an ICE quiz that will ensure you understand the main concepts of this ICE. If you blindly trust ChatGPT versus understanding what you're coding, you will not do well on the ICE quiz.  

Within ICE2, you will see a note regarding Nengo literature, stating that there are resources that might look very similar to your ICE2 assignment. It will be abundantly clear to me if you directly copy from the Nengo literature - _do not do that otherwise your grade will suffer_.

(1) Ensure you are using your 495 Virtual Environment created via instructions [here](https://github.com/kaitlin-fair/495venv_setup). 

(2) Open ICE2_SNN.ipynb. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the code. 

(3) Run Black to check your code for minor errors and improper formatting using the following command (I did this in the terminal within VS code): `black --check .`
